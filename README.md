In the plane detection task based on depth maps as input, growth-based methods have shown success. We have improved upon existing state-of-the-art methods by using the Taichi language to parallelize the plane growing process. This significantly reduces the time required for plane detection at the cost of slightly lower plane detection accuracy.
